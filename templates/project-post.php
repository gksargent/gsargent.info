        <p>With our fast-paced world and “always connected” lifestyles, it’s easy to forget that being a parent takes special care and effort. Work, professional development, church commitments and household chores all demand our attention, and as adults we are looking to check things off the list and move on. The thing we have to remember is that our kids need our time.</p>

        <p>This PSA is to encourage parents to take an active role in planning to spend time with their children. Plan a hike in the mountains. Feed the ducks at the lake. Walk around in a big city and take it all in.</p>

        <p>These ads will be placed in locations where parents will see them and serve as a reminder to take the time to be a parent. No one is perfect, but here are a few ideas to get you going.</p>

        <blockquote>No one is perfect, but here are a few ideas to get you going.</blockquote>

        <p>My objective is to show young parents spending time with their kids. As a parent of four, I feel a certain level of “impostor syndrome” in my efforts of being a parent. I view myself as still an immature child and hugely ill-equipped to be teaching and leading a pack of munchkins in life. I’m sure others my age feel the same and will appreciate a positive reminder that life is short, and spending time with your kids will help them get more out of life.</p>
